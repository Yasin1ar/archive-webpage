# Archive repo for the evolution of my web page 'amirany.net'

## It's cool to keep track of things, especially things that progress over time and means to you. so here I keep track of 'amirany.net'. 
### Unfortunatly for me, I do not have the first two version of the blog. It might not be very common to lose a project source code at this age of backup and project manager tools, yet I could manage to lose it! good job Yasin.

v1 till v3, amirany.net is just a web page, no bloging functionality.
